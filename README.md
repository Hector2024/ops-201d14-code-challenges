# Welcome to ops-201d14-code-challenges


    What is this repo all about?
This repo is a combination of some of the skills I have learned as I have gone through the CodeFellows bootcamp. Some PowerShell, Bash, and some code basics to show my understanding.

    Why these skills?
I am learning these skills not only as part of the bootcamp but also to help me build my foundational knowledge, curiosity, and passion for the field.

    What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?

With these challenges I learned basic things like Variables, Arrays, Loops, and conditionals. I also learned how to make batch scripts, change permissions, change access, and how to execute a program from the command line

    What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
    
My favorite part was the the very first one, "Hello world", there's something about following tradition that makes me feel even though this was the easiest one there is so much more to learn and that the right of passage is only the begging.

    How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?

All the examples here can be applied if I were to ever need to change something on a user's computer that the company decided is part of the SOP. Anything that the user does not need access to or that can cause potential damage can be changed.    
    
    What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?

Not the scripts themselves but my basic understanding of bash and Python. When my understanding of the languages improves so will my creativity and ability to know how to improve the scripts

    What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?

I would like to improve my "if/then/else" or being able to batch script the shell commands according to an SOP so I automate the commands and save everyone sometime.
